						<p>I have a disability. I do not understand the word "NO"</p>
						<p>A first-generation college student from a modest background, my life was filled with uncertainties. Through it all, my parents instilled in me a determination to excel in every challenge, to persevere in difficult times, and to cultivate a mindset that denies ‘impossible’ity. I accept failure wholeheartedly, but I never mistake it as final; instead, I view it as a stepping stone to greater success.</p>
						<p>Today, my background reminds me to be grateful for the opportunities I've been given, to maximize those opportunities, and to give back to the community that has supported my journey. I seek to make a meaningful impact by leveraging my skills and knowledge to develop innovative solutions that address community challenges. Through collaboration and creative problem-solving, I aim to drive positive change and create opportunities for others to thrive.</p>

						<p class="description">
							As a Software Development Intern at MyTutorial, I engineered a full-stack application utilizing React.js, MongoDB, and Bootstrap. I implemented a secure login system for students, teachers, and administrators, employing 'bcrypt' for password hashing to ensure robust security. I designed a comprehensive score tracking system that empowered teachers to input monthly test scores and enabled students to monitor their academic progress. Additionally, I integrated a dynamic calendar feature using the react-calendar library to efficiently display timetables, significantly enhancing the overall user experience.

						<p class="description">
							As a Student Researcher in the <strong>Scribe AR Research Group</strong> at UIUC, I developed a sophisticated speech-to-text web application tailored for classroom settings. Utilizing React, JavaScript, CSS, and various APIs, including Whisper and Azure, I created a tool designed to enhance transcription accuracy and accessibility for educational environments. This project not only demonstrated my technical skills in web development and integration but also showcased my ability to conduct research and solve complex problems related to speech recognition and real-time data processing.

						<p class="description">
							I published a research paper titled “Sanskrit as a Programming Language” in the <strong>International Journal of Computer Trends and Technology</strong>. This paper explored the innovative concept of using Sanskrit, an ancient language, as a programming language and presented a basic prototype to demonstrate the feasibility of this idea. The research aimed to bridge the gap between classical languages and modern programming paradigms. The significance of this work was recognized with the <trong>Young Researcher Award of India</trong> from the <strong>Institute of Scholars (InSc)</strong> and the <strong>Best Presentation Award</strong> at the pan-India <strong>Athena Research Conference</strong>. These accolades highlighted the impact and originality of my research in the field of computer science and programming languages.

						<p class="description">
							At the BuildIllinois Hackathon, I developed the lline Project, a Swift application designed to determine waiting times at dining halls and similar locations. The application utilized Swift's Multipeer Connectivity framework to create a graph of student activity and employed Python's NetworkX library to plot and traverse the graph using Breadth-First Search (BFS). This innovative project earned 4th place out of nearly 50 teams, showcasing its effectiveness and originality.
